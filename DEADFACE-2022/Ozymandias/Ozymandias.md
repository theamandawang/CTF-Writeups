I absolutely ADORE Breaking Bad, so I HAD to solve this challenge; and I'm glad I did in the end!
The challenge: 

> Ozymandias, by PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY
>
> I met a traveler from an antique land, Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal, these words appear:

That mystery text looks like base 32; so I convert it from base 32 CKR into ASCII with ```JXlate```, and our new string is:

```HHXCbA6nkjCq41YCGpguwhENTyLBxgmCHoku2MrZ2GZxPFSa31tJiQFu3byQH7GHXsArHi1wBdSiQxJYY1Zpx2PsornABdzkqBJndJSq9crN2Mv5LGoTiYh8Ydn1oitCmALVh8Kvn5HinLDdSvgextHNBypNsYq1j3hoGeiy```

I then decided to put this through ```CyberChef``` Magic mode; 

First, it converted from base 58 with alphabet ```rpshnaf39wBUDNEGHJKLM4PQRST7VWXYZ2bcdeCg65jkm8oFqi1tuvAxyz```

Then, it converted from base 85 with alphabet ```0-9A-Za-z!#$%&()*+\-;<=>?@^_`{|}~```
